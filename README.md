# Template Repository

This repository serves as a template for creating new projects. It contains all the necessary workspace files to build, run, and update your project, along with the necessary files and directory structures to get you started quickly.

## How to Use This Template

Follow these steps to create a new project based on this template:

### Step 1: Fork the Template Repository

- Navigate to the main page of this template repository.
- Click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Clone the Forked Repository

- On your forked repository page, click the "Code" button and copy the URL.
- Open a terminal on your local machine.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the `cd` command.
- Run the command `git clone <URL>`, replacing `<URL>` with the URL you copied.

### Step 3: Set Up the New Repository

- If you want to disconnect your project from the original template repository, you can do so by removing the original remote named "origin". Run the command `git remote remove origin`.
- Then, you can add a new remote that points to a new repository on GitHub. First, create a new repository on GitHub. Then, run the command `git remote add origin <new-repo-url>`, replacing `<new-repo-url>` with the URL of your new repository.

Now, you're all set to start working on your new project! Remember to regularly commit your changes and push them to GitHub to keep your remote repository up-to-date. Happy coding! ðŸš€
